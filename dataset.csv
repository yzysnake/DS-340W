"If you use steel rails instead of concrete and larger train cars, perhaps even multiple train cars coupled together, then this metro idea could work out great. Public transportation is no small task, but i am confident that you guys can make an amazing system if you scale things up a little bit.",1
"As much as I greatly respect Elon's ingenuity, I think he's off the mark on this. There just seems to be a lot that can go wrong jamming tens of thousands of cars through a tube each day. I would like to see him perfect the underground high speed Maglev mass transit system. It just seems to make more sense getting all those single occupant vehicles off the road.",-1
Finally a CEO which fulfills his visions. Keep it up mr. Musk!,1
Elon really doesnt fear making claustrophofobic designs,-1
dont forget to place torches or mobs will spawn in there,0
Promised: 155mph autonomous 16 passenger pod.     Produced: 30 mph piloted 4 passenger teslas,-1
"wow, Elon invented the subway, amazing!",-1
"Reminds me of a combination of Japanese parking lot buildings with robotic car elevators & the ""Transitway"" system they have here in Ottawa, exclusive roads for public transport; except underground and for private citizens.",0
"This just seems like a metro, but less efficient",-1
"I like how they went with the harder, heavy metal sound on this one compared to the sleeker, richer urban vibes of the CGI renders",1
"Man is this how we go from city to city. It's going to suck not seeing the nice blue sky, the trees, the mountains when going on a road trip. Road trips would feel like crap going in these garbage tunnels",-1
"I think the majority of the time will be consumed in making this system idiot proof, what if someone litters in the tunnel and it ends up being a hazard to the people behind?",0
"so basically its the highway that's only one lane, with a claustrophobia inducing design, and with narrow walls meaning its much slower and more dangerous, not to mention more expensive to produce. The existing highway system and a new high speed rail would do the same thing more efficiently, and it would be cheaper to produce and to use. Just because something has never been done before doesn't make it innovation, in this case nobody done it before because its a shit idea. It makes me sick to think about how many struggling people could have been fed or even housed for the amount it cost to build this stupid tunnel just so that elon can satisfy his over-inflated ego and feel like he's doing something special",-1
"imagine an underground parking space where the owners can walk up to a machine and select their vehicle once they are done with their activities. Pedestrian activities aboveground, parking/inactivities underground.",0
Great idea to help the super rich get from a to b without having to queue behind the plebs.,-1
Only man I respect the most and look up to nobody greater than Elon Musk such a legend,1
"We all know, eventually somebody is gonna hack into this and cause devastation.",-1
"It would be so cool to contact a bunch of local artists from the areas to cover all the tunnels in murals.  It would be an amazing way to show the artistic side of the cities as well, knowing you left one place into another because of the changes of style and depictions of what’s in the art.  A nice cultural touch to the whole thing",1
"This is like endless, loop hole night mare",-1
Exciting to see this ride.,1
They should use this tunnel to travel around the world with the Tesla,0
"What I would be afraid of each time I went down one of these is the possibility that either the passenger inside the vehicle gets stuck in the tunnel via the tunnel system having an error (some kind of malfunction etc. if that is possible) or your vehicle can’t handle the speeds you are moving due to your vehicles specs/age/own mechanical failures. Either way, I like the idea. Beware those with claustrophobia.",-1
im not a native english speaker so when i first heard of this company i litterally thought the company was calling itself boring,0
If there is a separate tunnels for only ambulances for serious patients to reach the hospital in minimum time that would be a great to save lifes .,1
"Car elevators arn't needed. Simply use existing car garages in the city under buildings as entry/exit points by building extra ground floor for entering into tunells. Cars can travel from one garage to another through tunells at high speeds, freeing streets. Great idea. For higher speeds air should be pumped in the direction of traffic to reduce air friction. Besides little wheels reinforced bumpers should be added. In case of power loss other cars can always push it through from behind.",1
Another great product keep up the work Elon,1
"Out of curiosity, what improvements would need to be made for the boring machine to tunnel and make bricks in low G?  I presume dust would be a significant issue so sealing critical components.  Not sure what goes into actually making the bricks.  Is it something that could be done naturally on the moon or Mars?",0
This is the scariest thing ever trust Elon musk to make something like this,-1
"It actually is a dream of mine to travel underground to places I wanna be very quick, like school and gym",1
"But wha takes off that boot thing after you're done, or you just keep it on the car?",0
Bro Elon musk is taking the world to the next level,1
"Let's make something like this but for bigger vehicles, trains maybe. I think we can call it subway",-1
"My question is... If it takes 30 seconds to be lowered into the tunnel and 30 seconds for the lift to return to the surface,  if there were 50 vehicles in rush hour trying to use this, wouldnt car number 50 be waiting 50 minutes, and also once inside, If there was a variant of 2mph difference in every other cars speed, wouldnt there be a jam at the tunnels exit?",-1
"The nice thing about this tunnel, is that instead of having to take a tram or bus/taxi from point A to get to a station somewhere and then walking to point B from the station, in this tunnel you have your car with you once you've gotten to the end of it. With the tunnel, you can just drive to point B without having to walk or pay! Sorry for my run-off sentences",1
I really thought the tunnel would be bigger when I heard the idea…,-1
"So is the car driving that, or is it getting pushed along by some sort of mechanism?",0
"Elon's vision that he shared to us through his visual models showed a single lane track of sorts, With an already made catch/lift that your car would just drive up onto, and be transported on through the tunnels with. This silly car part upgrade with the outward facing wheels is in aid of the opposite of his vision. Whats going on here!???! Compromise i dare hear you say!? Nay!",-1
So AMAZING,1
But what about the guide wheels? Do you need those installed prior to entering the loop or do you drive onto a pair when entering?,0
"I wish I had the money to do this. I have always thought about this idea even as my high school project on how to beat traffic in LA.
Keep up the great idea and push ELON. I wish to be working with one of your companies.",1
"Amazing idea and proof of concept, I'm excited to see this in the future",1
Just to people out there who misunderstand this technology. This is to fix very inefficient city planning. Modern and well planned cities will have no need for this. Public transport is still waaaaay better and more efficient.,1
imagine your car is too short and it just smashes your car :D,-1
"Elon gets tired of sitting in traffic and comes up with the idea of a tunnel, he makes the reality. Then he sells hats for his new company. 50k hats later he gets tired of his hats and makes FUCKING FLAMETHROWERS. then after all of that he shot a tesla into space with the world's most powerful rocket at the time. And he hosted meme review. I fucking love elon musk",1
remember when u were supposed to drive a car and not ride it,-1
Why do I have the feeling that this system is going to be exclusive to the elite?,-1
Elon... Combine your Boring company with desonilasation to solve the brine disposal issue. Tunnels will be the perfect solution for transporting brine to deserts to create brine lakes to lower temp and fix Cali's water issue.,1
"So, you have to get out of the car and somehow install special equipment to your front wheels which goes into your wheel hub nuts.
Then you drive the car yourself inside the tunnel. Hoping nobody got stuck in it for any reason. Otherwise you have a big problem...
Then you get out from the other side and remove that special equipment from your wheels.
Looks like a big fail...",-1
Seems like an expensive version of a subway train. I think Elon would be better off just selling the tunneling service for cities to build subways.,-1
how will this be better than trains?,-1
