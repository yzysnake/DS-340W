"If you use steel rails instead of concrete and larger train cars, perhaps even multiple train cars coupled together, then this metro idea could work out great. Public transportation is no small task, but i am confident that you guys can make an amazing system if you scale things up a little bit.",netrual
"As much as I greatly respect Elon's ingenuity, I think he's off the mark on this. There just seems to be a lot that can go wrong jamming tens of thousands of cars through a tube each day. I would like to see him perfect the underground high speed Maglev mass transit system. It just seems to make more sense getting all those single occupant vehicles off the road.",positive
Finally a CEO which fulfills his visions. Keep it up mr. Musk!,positive
"What a vision to put a car on rubber-tired métro tracks, indeed. Guess what, in Paris, they even have been putting trains on such tracks since 1951 - Lausanne uses it now among others. And Mercedes-Benz also made a similar O-Bahn with buses in Adelaide in the 1980s. That's where Musk got his idea. No innovation.",negative
"wow, Elon invented the subway, amazing!",positive
I feel like the litmus test for a Musk stan's rabidness is how hard they'll defend this idea.,positive
dont forget to place torches or mobs will spawn in there,netrual
Imagine a car going through this suddenly stop due to any reason and car coming from behind,negative
"What I would be afraid of each time I went down one of these is the possibility that either the passenger inside the vehicle gets stuck in the tunnel via the tunnel system having an error (some kind of malfunction etc. if that is possible) or your vehicle can’t handle the speeds you are moving due to your vehicles specs/age/own mechanical failures. Either way, I like the idea. Beware those with claustrophobia.",positive
"Out of curiosity, what improvements would need to be made for the boring machine to tunnel and make bricks in low G? I presume dust would be a significant issue so sealing critical components. Not sure what goes into actually making the bricks. Is it something that could be done naturally on the moon or Mars?",netrual
